The hackathon for Hackfest 2025 by GDG Cloud Delhi, sponsored by Agora, is a 24-hour online event designed to develop innovative solutions around Conversational AI for healthcare and wellbeing.

### Hackfest 2025 Overview

- Organized by: Google Developer Groups Cloud New Delhi
- Sponsor: Agora
- Format: 24-hours online hackathon
- Key Track: Conversational AI for Healthcare Wellbeing.


### Problem Statement

The primary challenge is improving the medical appointment booking process in India, which currently suffers from repetitive phone calls, outdated doctor availability information, language barriers, unverified bookings, and accessibility issues for elderly or speech-impaired patients.

### Team Details (hawkeye.exe)

- Om Singh: Frontend Lead (Team Lead)
- Noman Aqil: Backend Lead
- Alwin Mathew: AI API Lead


### Solution Proposal

Arogya, the proposed solution, leverages Agora's Conversational AI to:

- Use natural voice conversation to gather patient symptoms and preferences.
- Automate calls to verify doctor availability in real time.
- Ensure only confirmed and verified booking slots for patients, minimizing false bookings.


### Additional Notes

Data from healthcare surveys show patients spend about 45 minutes and average 2-3 attempts just to book one appointment, with 30% hospital no-show rates due to miscommunication and false confirmations. The hackathon aims to solve these issues, saving time for both patients and hospitals.
